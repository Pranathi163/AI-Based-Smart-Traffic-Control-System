# AI-Based-Smart-Traffic-Control-System
The AI-Based Smart Traffic Control System is an intelligent traffic management solution designed to optimize traffic light timing based on real-time road congestion. Instead of following traditional time-based traffic signals, this system uses computer vision (OpenCV) to dynamically assess vehicle density on each road connected to a junction and intelligently assign green light duration accordingly.

By deploying cameras and applying image processing techniques, the system detects the number of vehicles at intersections, reducing unnecessary waiting time and improving traffic flow efficiency.
